# Rate-Monotonic-Scheduling-Automatic-RM-Aperiodic-Tasks
This project implements a system that plays two Super Mario Bros songs using a PWM-driven buzzer on the ESP32.  It includes button input, interrupts, periodic and aperiodic tasks, custom GPIO and PWM abstractions, and a custom-configurable thread management system.
